**User Stories**

🐿️ As a user, I want the website design to adjust using media queries so that it works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens.

🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images so my screen reader can interpret and convey the content to me effectively.

🐿️ As a user, I want to easily switch between images in the gallery using buttons so that my experience is smooth and intuitive.

    *Requirements*
    🎯 Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).
    🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
    🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.

**Stretch Goals**

_Stretch User Stories_

🐿️ As a user, I want the website to use ‘srcset’ to display appropriately sized images for my device, so that images load quickly and look sharp on any screen.

🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I want ARIA elements, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes, to improve my interaction with the website.

🐿️ As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts, like arrow keys, to switch between images easily.

🐿️ As a user on various devices, I want the website to adapt to different screen sizes through the use of media queries for an optimal viewing experience.

    *Stretch Requirements*
    🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
    🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
    🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.
    🏹 Develop media queries for multiple screen sizes.

**Reflection**

Please also provide an assignment reflection in your project README.md file.

    *Required*
    🎯 What requirements did you achieve?
        didn't achieve much jusy managed to do the thumbnail work my large image container doesn't work.(ps. after submission i managed to find the issue and changed it i was not passing the correct parameter as i was passing the whole array instead of only one clicked image data.)
        i managed to add the alt text for the images for the accessability.

    🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?
        majority of them.
    🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?
        i feel like i need more practice on javascript .

_Optional_

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

    🎯Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

    🎯What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?
        https://youtu.be/C1B1Fx3XKOg?si=f8LZD-ZT58DP9ZxV
        https://youtu.be/Zi-Q0t4gMC8?si=digftFqcpt4JBcRf(i watched about 40min of this ).

        what helped the most was the walking skeleton provided in class as it helped pave the way on how to tackleto try and tackle the assignment. as i was doing it i went through most of the demos in class to try and recal especially how to do the arrays, functions and loops.
    🎯What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?
        the error encountered were on the javascript and what helped were my classmates whom i consulted and were able to give me an overview on where i might have gone wrong. i'm really greatfull to them.
    🎯What went really well and what could have gone better?

        i need to work more on my javascript by doing more projects so that i may remember the concepts more easily.
