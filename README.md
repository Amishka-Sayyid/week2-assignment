**User Stories**

🐿️ As a user, I want the website design to adjust using media queries so that it works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens.

🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images so my screen reader can interpret and convey the content to me effectively.

🐿️ As a user, I want to easily switch between images in the gallery using buttons so that my experience is smooth and intuitive.

    *Requirements*
    🎯 Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).
    🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
    🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.

**Stretch Goals**

_Stretch User Stories_

🐿️ As a user, I want the website to use ‘srcset’ to display appropriately sized images for my device, so that images load quickly and look sharp on any screen.

🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I want ARIA elements, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes, to improve my interaction with the website.

🐿️ As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts, like arrow keys, to switch between images easily.

🐿️ As a user on various devices, I want the website to adapt to different screen sizes through the use of media queries for an optimal viewing experience.

    *Stretch Requirements*
    🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
